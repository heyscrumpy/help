## How We Started Scrumpy

We've co-founded an agency for digital products a while ago. To plan our projects we used Trello and JIRA, depending on the project scope. We're a small team of around 10 people and Trello felt too easy and JIRA too complex. So we did the only logical thing: We build our own solution.

We've built the first version of Scrumpy on the side while running the agency. After using it for our own projects a few months we decided to make Scrumpy public, so other teams could use it too. So we launched a MVP in April 2018. ðŸš€
