# Overview

Scrumpy is an agile project management tool. But what does agile actually mean? How can agile make your everyday life easier? We wrote a short guide to help you work agile with Scrumpy.

Agile has its roots in software development, but can be used in many areas. In the last decades more and more companies have changed their complete way of working to agile methods. The overall goal is to make processes transparent and flexible, to achieve results faster and to make project predictable.

## Agile Methodologies

With Scrumpy we support two of the most popular working methods, you can try both and see what works better for your team.

### Visualize your progress with Kanban

**Maybe you haven't heard of Kanban yet, but you may have seen it already. The basic idea of Kanban is to visualize the progress of the work in an easy way.**

All tasks have to be written down and then divided into three columns: Todo, Doing and Done. At the beginning of each project the Todo column is full of tasks. When the team starts with a task, it is moved to the Doing column. This way the whole team can see at a glance what is happening. When the task is completed, it is moved to the Done column. Tasks move from left to right over time. With a short look at your Kanban board you'll see how many tasks are open, in progress or completed.

This makes Kanban particularly suitable for projects where most tasks are clear at the beginning and the tasks simply have to be completed. You can use Kanban for a **website relaunch, the organization of an event or a list of user feedback**.

### Make long projects planable with Scrum

**Scrum is the most popular method, but there are a few things that you have to get used to.**

In Scrum projects, all tasks are recorded and prioritized in a long list, the so-called backlog. But instead of just working through the list, the team plans a lot of small projects, so-called sprints. Sprints are work packages of (for example) two weeks. Before each sprint, the team discusses open tasks and decides which tasks they want to work on. After each sprint, the team meets again and presents the results. This is followed by the next sprint. This way the whole project is divided into a lot of tiny projects.

Scrumpy is perfect for long projects where most of the tasks is unclear in advance. Scrum brings a lot of transparency and flexibility to every project, and requires everyone involved to rethink. Scrum is perfectly suited to **plan an app, to keep track of internal restructuring processes or the further development of a digital product**.

## The right method for your team

Agile is not a shoe you can just put on. It takes a while for a team to get rid of old structures and see the benefits of Agile. In the end, the most important thing is to find a method that suits your team and your project.
