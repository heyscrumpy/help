# Sprints

Sprints divide a large project into many small projects. This is great if you want to achieve a constant, reliable speed as a team. This will reduce stress and make the project more predictable.

Tasks always end up in the backlog. Before each sprint, the team decides which of the tasks they would like to work on. The team moves these tasks into the sprint. It varies how long a sprint lasts. Two weeks is a good starting point. The decision can be made together with the team. Some teams for example prefer 4-week sprints.

During the sprint, the goal is that the team can concentrate fully on the tasks in the sprint. For the project manager, the task is to keep all stress away from the team. After a sprint, the team then presents what it has achieved.

Once a sprint has been completed, it starts all over again. The team takes on tasks again for a new sprint and works again with concentration. Within a sprint you have a Kanban board, by default with the columns Todo, Doing and Done. Of course you can also create your own columns. Click on the three points at the top of the column.

If your team has made a few sprints, you will get a great evaluation under Review. This will help you to look ahead in the project.
