# Introduction

Hi! Thanks for checking in. This is the place where we constantly add content to answer frequently asked questions.

I guess we didn't answer everything yet, so don't hesitate to use the chat bubble on the bottom to ask us everything you like.

If you want to add something or correct a typo, this page is open source. Click on “Edit this page on GitHub” to suggest a change. Or send us a short message, we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Thanks & have a nice day!<br />
Philipp & Hans from Scrumpy ✌️
